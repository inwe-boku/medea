In this paper, we measure the external effect of wind turbines on the transaction prices of nearby houses. A unique Dutch house price dataset covering the period 1985–2011 is used, as well as the exact location of all wind turbines that were built in the Netherlands. Using a difference-in-differences methodology we find a 1.4\% price decrease for houses within 2 km of a turbine. There is also evidence for anticipation effects a few years before placement of a turbine. The effect is larger for taller turbines and in urban areas. Especially the first turbine built close to a house has a negative effect on its price.},

In the tradition of studies in environmental, public and urban economics, housing sales prices are used to reveal local preferences for views of wind farm developments. Estimation is based on quasi-experimental research designs that compare price changes occurring in places where wind farms become visible, with price changes in appropriate comparison groups. These groups include places close to wind farms that became visible in the past, or where they will become operational in the future and places close to wind farms sites but where the turbines are hidden by the terrain. All these comparisons suggest that wind farm visibility reduces local house prices, and the implied visual environmental costs are substantial.},

  abstract = {Wind energy developments are often controversial. Concerns are often raised about negative impacts on local communities, including impacts on property values. Some of these negative impacts may be offset by compensatory payments made by wind developers. Community involvement in the planning and development process may also reduce negative perceptions associated with wind facilities. However, if the development is near a border between municipalities, states, or even countries, it is often the case that one or more jurisdictions will not be involved in the process or receive compensation, but will, nonetheless, face some costs or impacts from the development. We explore exactly this situation at the border between Canada and the United States in the Thousand Islands region where a wind farm is currently operating on the Canadian border island of Wolfe Island. Using a parcel-level hedonic analysis of property sales transactions, we find that properties in New York with a view of and/or in close proximity to the turbines significantly depreciated in value after construction of the turbines while no negative impacts were observed on properties in Ontario. We highlight a number of factors that could contribute to these differences in impacts on property values, which may also explain the variation in results that currently exists in the literature.},

We estimate hedonic difference-in-differences models that allow for impacts of wind turbines by proximity, viewshed, and contrast with surrounding development. Across a wide variety of specifications, the results suggest that wind turbines have no statistically significant negative impacts on house prices, in either the post public announcement phase or post construction phase. Further, the lower bound of statistically possible impacts is still outweighed by the positive externalities generated from CO2 mitigation.},

  abstract = {Today's investment decisions in large-scale onshore wind projects in Germany are no longer determined only by the investment's economic benefit, but also by concerns associated to social acceptance. Despite a mostly positive attitude towards the expansion of wind power, local public concerns often stem from the belief that the proximity to large-scale wind farms may lead to a decrease in property prices. In particular, the change in landscape caused by the construction of a wind farm may have an adverse impact on the view from some properties, and thus may negatively affect their price. To investigate the potential devaluation of properties in Germany due to wind farms, we use a quasi-experimental technique and apply a spatial difference-in-differences approach to various wind farm sites in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. We adopt a quantitative visual impact assessment approach to account for the adverse environmental effects caused by the wind turbines. To properly account for spatial dependence and unobserved variables biases, we apply augmented spatial econometric models. The estimates indicate that the asking price for properties whose view was strongly affected by the construction of wind turbines decreased by about 9–14\%. In contrast, properties with a minor or marginal view on the wind turbines experienced no devaluation.},

Such concerns arose in Melancthon Township (in southern Ontario) following the construction of a large wind farm. Existing literature has not reached a consensus regarding the nature of these impacts. This paper applies a hedonic approach to detailed data on 5,414 rural residential sales and 1,590 farmland sales to estimate the impacts of Melancthon's wind turbines on surrounding property values. These impacts are accounted for through both proximity to turbines and turbine visibility?two factors that may contribute to a disamenity effect. The results of the hedonic models, which are robust to a number of alternate model specifications including a repeat sales analysis, suggest that these wind turbines have not significantly impacted nearby property values. Thus, these results do not corroborate the concerns raised by residents regarding potential negative impacts of turbines on property values.},

We find that on-shore wind turbines negatively affect the price of surrounding properties to a distance of three kilometers. The negative impact increases with the number of wind turbines at a declining marginal rate but declines with distance. In the case of off-shore wind turbine farms, we do not find a significant effect of having an off-shore wind farm in view from a property itself or from the nearest beach, likely because the closest off-shore turbine is 9 km from the closest traded home. We illustrate the policy relevance of our findings by providing maps showing how the marginal impact of a wind turbine varies across the landscape according to the spatial distribution of home density and homes values in the proximity of a wind turbine site. The results suggest that ceteris paribus, wind turbine farms should be built quite far away from residential areas with turbines gathered in larger wind farms rather than installed as single turbines.},

Because some of that deployment is expected to occur in relatively populous areas, concerns have arisen about the impact of turbines on nearby home values. Previous research on the effects of wind turbines on surrounding home values has been limited by small home-sale data samples and insufficient consideration of confounding home-value factors and spatial dependence. This study examines the largest set of turbine-proximal sales data to date: more than 50,000 home sales including 1,198 within 1 mile of a turbine (331 of which were within a half mile). The data span the periods well before announcement of the wind facilities to well after their construction. We use ordinary least squares and spatial-process difference-in-difference hedonic models to estimate the home-value impacts of the wind facilities, controlling for value factors existing prior to the wind facilities’ announcements, the spatial dependence of home values, and value changes over time. A series of robustness models provide greater confidence in the results. We find no statistical evidence that home values near turbines were affected in the turbine post-construction or post-announcement/pre-construction periods.},

Old houses and those in rural areas are affected the most, while home prices in urban areas are hardly affected.

  abstract = {Based on a data-intensive weather-driven modelling approach, technically and economically optimal designs are derived for a simplified, highly renewable pan-European electricity system, which minimise the need for backup energy, backup capacity, transmission capacity and the levelised system cost of delivered electricity. The overall cost-optimal design, based on standard cost assumptions, relies on synchronised backup across the transmission grid and comes with a renewable penetration of 50\% with a rather high wind fraction of 94\%. Given the current European electricity consumption, this corresponds to 600 GW rated wind power capacities, 60 GW installed solar power capacities, 320 GW conventional backup power capacity, and about five times today's installed transmission capacities. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the design and cost of the optimal system depend mostly on the assumed cost of wind capacity and fuel for backup energy. Lower costs for wind capacity, higher costs for backup energy and usage of otherwise curtailed excess electricity generation lead to a strong increase of the optimal renewable penetration. The sensitivity analysis is also used to find that a CO2 tax of over 100 €/ton would be needed for the economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration.},

  abstract = {The resource quality and the temporal generation pattern of variable renewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper spatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit this heterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of renewable electricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal portfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal distributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs of backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current cost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind, particularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average electricity costs that are up to 11\% lower than for a homogeneous reference distribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load. The reduction becomes even larger, namely 18\%, once the transmission capacities are put to zero in the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to distribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar capacity factors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to fully optimised renewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits of transparency and comprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results to changing costs of solar generation and gas supply as well as to the possible cross-sectoral usage of unavoidable curtailment energy are also examined.},

  abstract = {To reach ambitious European CO2 emission reduction targets, most scenarios of future European electricity systems rely on large shares of wind and solar photovoltaic power generation. We interpolate between two concepts for balancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental scales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This interpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities from the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for the capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as pumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95\% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical year of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the cost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy generation is dominated by wind (65\%) and hydro (15\%), with average system costs comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance in favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction is relaxed, 85\% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be captured already with only 44\% of the transmission volume.},

  abstract = {Solar irradiation and wind speed vary with climatic, as well as seasonal and daily weather conditions. In order to represent these variable renewable energy (VRE) resources in specialized energy system models, high temporal and spatial resolution information on their availability is used. In contrast, integrated assessment models (IAM), typically characterized by long-term time scales and low temporal and spatial resolution, require aggregated information on VRE availability and balancing requirements at various levels of VRE penetration and mix. Parametric studies that provide such information typically regard solar energy synonymously with photovoltaic power generation. However, solar energy can also be harvested with concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, which can be dispatchable if equipped with thermal storage. Accounting for this dispatchable use of the variable solar resource can change the balancing requirements at any solar energy penetration level. In this paper, we present an application of the high-resolution energy system model REMix to a set of European supply scenarios with theoretical VRE shares ranging from 0\% to 140\%, three solar-to-wind ratios, with CSP included in the solar share. We evaluate balancing measures, curtailments and costs and compare the findings to previous results in which CSP is regarded a backup option among other dispatchable power plants. The results show that CSP potentials in Europe are widely exploited in most scenarios. System costs are found to be lowest for wind-dominated systems or balanced mixes of wind and solar and for an overall VRE share between 40\% for a low and 80\% for a high scenario of the future CO2 emission certificate price. The comparison with previous results shows that storage capacity is the only system variable that is significantly affected by allocating CSP to the VRE resources category. It is reduced by 24\% on average across all VRE shares and proportions and by around 80\% at most.},

A new methodology is developed that focuses on renewable resource and variation management in combination with transmission expansion and curtailment of excess electricity generation. Using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure in the objective function, the optimization model targets the residual load and tailors it to fit the baseload generation. Using Europe as an example, the results show that it is possible to tailor the residual load to fit the baseload with only a small sacrifice (∼1\%) of output of generation from variable renewable energy sources (VRES). Expansion of the electricity transmission system is an important factor in accommodating baseload generation in systems with a high penetration level of VRES, whereby, for example, 50 GW of transmission capacity opens the way for baseload generation to increase from 20\% to 32\% of annual demand. The results show that wind power is the main contributor to VRES production, even in the case of exceptionally low future costs for solar PV.},

The results show that wind energy production could be expanded to 20\% of the final end energy demand in three out of four scenarios. However, more restrictive criteria increase LCOE by up to 20\%. In contrast to common views that see local opposition against wind projects as the main barrier for wind power expansion, our participatory modeling approach indicates that even on the level of key stakeholders, the future possible contribution of wind energy to Austrian renewable energy targets reaches from almost no further expansion to very high shares of wind energy.},

  abstract = {Wind energy has emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, yet the impacts of wind facilities on wildlife remain unclear. Prior studies estimate between 10,000 and 573,000 fatal bird collisions with U.S. wind turbines annually; however, these studies do not differentiate between turbines with a monopole tower and those with a lattice tower, the former of which now comprise the vast majority of all U.S. wind turbines and the latter of which are largely being de-commissioned. We systematically derived an estimate of bird mortality for U.S. monopole turbines by applying inclusion criteria to compiled studies, identifying correlates of mortality, and utilizing a predictive model to estimate mortality along with uncertainty. Despite measures taken to increase analytical rigor, the studies we used may provide a non-random representation of all data; requiring industry reports to be made publicly available would improve understanding of wind energy impacts. Nonetheless, we estimate that between 140,000 and 328,000 (mean=234,000) birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S. We found support for an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height and support for differing mortality rates among regions, with per turbine mortality lowest in the Great Plains. Evaluation of risks to birds is warranted prior to continuing a widespread shift to taller wind turbines. Regional patterns of collision risk, while not obviating the need for species-specific and local-scale assessments, may inform broad-scale decisions about wind facility siting.},

As one of the few countries, Germany decided on an accelerated shift towards green energy, resulting in substantial conflicts with international conservation goals. Currently, large numbers of wind power facilities are erected in Germany, yet with unforeseen consequences for wildlife, particularly for endangered and protected bats. Presumably, more than 250,000 bats are killed annually due to interactions with German wind turbines, and total losses may account for more than two million killed bats over the past 10 years, if mitigation measures were not practiced. More than 70 \% of killed bats are migrants, because major migratory routes cross Germany. Consequently, Germany’s environmental policy is key to the conservation of migratory bats in Europe. Prospective increases in wind power will lead to the installation of larger wind turbines with potentially devastating consequences for bats. The higher net energy production of modern wind turbines at low wind speeds may exacerbate the conflict between green energy and conservation goals since revenue losses for companies increase. We conclude that evidence-based action plans are urgently needed to mitigate the negative effects of the operation of wind energy facilities on wildlife populations in order to reconcile environmental and conservation goals.},

The relative economic values of different types of externalities as well as the impact of various methodological and sample characteristics on welfare estimates are examined. The results indicate a significant effect of visual externalities on welfare estimates in both directions, i.e., a positive effect of visual improvements and a negative effect of deteriorations. This finding corresponds to predictions of the importance of visual impacts in the social science literature. External effects of wind power on biodiversity (mainly birds) do not affect welfare estimates. Indirect externalities caused by conventional sources of electricity that can be avoided by wind power, such as a the reduction of air pollution, do neither have a significant impact on welfare measures. Methodologically, we find substantial but inelastic income effects and, for choice experiments, clear evidence of sensitivity to scope. From a policy point of view, our results suggest that a policy mix combining a promotion of wind turbines with another green policy facilitates expansion of wind energy.},

Mitigation investment using resources diverted from conventional investments can raise the economic well-being of both current and future generations. The economic literature on GHG emissions misleadingly focuses attention on the intergenerational equity aspects of mitigation by using a hybrid constrained optimal path as the “business-as-usual” benchmark. We calibrate a simple Keynes-Ramsey growth model to illustrate the significant potential Pareto improvement from mitigation investment and to explain the equilibrium concept appropriate to modeling an uncorrected negative externality.},

This paper proposes a framework to analyze and quantify these costs. We propose a definition of integration costs based on the marginal economic value of electricity, or market value – as such a definition can be more easily used in economic cost-benefit assessment than previous approaches. We suggest decomposing integration costs intro three components, according to the principal characteristics of wind and solar power: temporal variability, uncertainty, and location-constraints. Quantitative estimates of these components are extracted from a review of 100 + published studies. At high penetration rates, say a wind market share of 30–40\%, integration costs are found to be 25–35 €/MWh, i.e. up to 50\% of generation costs. While these estimates are system-specific and subject to significant uncertainty, integration costs are certainly too large to be ignored in high-penetration assessments (but might be ignored at low penetration). The largest single factor is reduced utilization of capital embodied in thermal plants, a cost component that has not been accounted for in most previous integration studies.},

  abstract = {LCOE (levelized costs of electricity) are a common metric for comparing power generating technologies. However, there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values. We find that at high wind shares integration costs can be in the same range as generation costs of wind power and conventional plants in particular due to a cost component “profile costs” captured by the new definition. Integration costs increase with growing wind shares and might become an economic barrier to deploying VRE at high shares. System LCOE help understanding and resolving the challenge of integrating VRE and can guide research and policy makers in realizing a cost-efficient transformation towards an energy system with potentially high shares of variable renewables.},

Replacing old wind turbines by modern ones and building new turbines on land will be crucial in meeting this target. However, the expansion of onshore wind power is not universally accepted. In several regions of Germany residents are protesting against setting up new wind turbines. To determine the negative effects two choice experiments were applied in Westsachsen and Nordhessen, Germany. In both regions the externalities of wind power generation until 2020 based on today's state of technology were measured. The results show that negative landscape externalities would result from expanding wind power generation. Using latent class models three different groups of respondents experiencing different degrees of externalities were identified.},

The external effects we consider are those on landscape quality, wildlife and air quality. We also consider the welfare implications of different investment strategies for employment and electricity prices. The methodology used to do this is the choice experiment technique. Renewable technologies considered include hydro, on-shore and off-shore wind power and biomass. Welfare changes for different combinations of impacts associated with different investment strategies are estimated.

In the case of off-shore wind turbine farms, we do not find a significant effect of having an off-shore wind farm in view from a property itself or from the nearest beach, likely because the closest off-shore turbine is 9 km from the closest traded home. We illustrate the policy relevance of our findings by providing maps showing how the marginal impact of a wind turbine varies across the landscape according to the spatial distribution of home density and homes values in the proximity of a wind turbine site.

 calculations and future projections. Utility-scale PV LCOE in 2019 in Europe with 7\% nominal weighted average cost
 of capital (WACC) ranges from 24 €/MWh in Malaga to 42 €/MWh in Helsinki. This is remarkable since the average
 electricity day-ahead market price in Finland was 47 €/MWh and in Spain 57 €/MWh in 2018. This means that PV is
 already cheaper than average spot market electricity all over Europe. By 2030, PV LCOE will range from 14 €/MWh in
 Malaga to 24 €/MWh in Helsinki with 7\% nominal WACC. This range will be 9 to 15 €/MWh by 2050, making PV clearly
 the cheapest form of electricity generation everywhere. Sensitivity analysis shows that apart from location, WACC is
 the most important input parameter in the calculation of PV LCOE. Increasing nominal WACC from 2 to 10\% will double
 the LCOE. Changes in PV CAPEX and OPEX, learning rates, or market volume growth scenarios have a relatively smaller
 impact on future PV LCOE.},

  abstract = {Although wind power is currently the most efficient source of renewable energy, the installation of wind
 turbines (WT) in landscapes often leads to conflicts in the affected communities. We propose that such conflicts can
 be mitigated by a welfare-optimal spatial allocation of WT in the landscape so that a given energy target is reached
 at minimum social costs. The energy target is motivated by the fact that wind power production is associated with
 relatively low CO2 emissions. Social costs comprise energy production costs as well as external costs caused by
 harmful impacts on humans and biodiversity. We present a modeling approach that combines spatially explicit
 ecological–economic modeling and choice experiments to determine the welfare-optimal spatial allocation of WT in West
 Saxony, Germany. The welfare-optimal sites balance production and external costs. Results indicate that in the
 welfare-optimal allocation the external costs represent about 14% of the total costs (production costs plus external
 costs). Optimizing wind power production without consideration of the external costs would lead to a very different
 allocation of WT that would marginally reduce the production costs but strongly increase the external costs and thus
 lead to substantial welfare losses.}

    abstract = {Detailed information about the potential and costs of renewable energies is an important input for energy
 system models as well as for commercial and political decision-making processes. Especially wind energy with its
 increasing locally installed capacity and hub heights plays an important role when it comes to meeting climate
 targets and optimizing electricity networks. Recently however, wind energy has faced more and more social barriers
 and land use constraints which can negatively impact both political goals and investment decisions. Therefore this
 work presents a bottom-up methodology to estimate these effects by calculating the feasible potential and the
 associated costs for the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg as a case study. Landscape aesthetical aspects are
 considered and an algorithm applied based on graph-theoretical considerations to include spatial planning rules such
 as separation distances between wind farms. By means of spatially high-resolution land use data and techno-economic
 parameters, possible wind turbines are placed considering wind direction and variable spacing between turbines. In a
 further step, possible farm sites are located and assessed, and the result is presented in the form of cost-potential
 curves. The feasible potential is found to be between a third and a half of the technical potential and is between
 11.8 and 29.1 TWh, with costs between 6.7 and 12.6 €ct/kWh. In addition, a substantial spatial shift in the location
 of future wind energy production can be observed when wind farm spacing is taken into account. The quality of the
 algorithm is tested against already existing wind farms and areas that are approved by regional authorities for the
 use of wind energy, and a very good correlation is observed. The focus in future work should lie on the development
 of an economic criterion that, unlike the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is able to account for the system
 costs of a widespread wind energy development, including network expansion, balancing power and reserve energy costs.
 Further, visibility analysis could be implemented using digital elevation models to consider the topography for
 optimal wind farm spacing.},

Therefore the Geospatial Land Availability for Energy Systems (GLAES) model, a general framework for land eligibility investigation, is used to conduct a uniformly-constrained pan-European investigation of onshore wind land eligibility in which 31 socially and technologically driven constraints are imposed. A detailed characterization of the average wind resource and current land usage within the eligible areas is then discussed. Constraint sensitivity is then evaluated at both the European and national levels including the construction of a detailed sensitivity trend for all constraints. Ultimately, it is found that 26.24% of land is eligible across Europe, with the highest shares possessed by Spain, France and Sweden. On average across Europe, onshore wind land eligibility is most sensitive to the minimal wind speed, the maximal terrain slope, the maximal distance from power lines, and the minimal distance from settlements.},

Here this influence is studied using a techno-economic optimisation model for a networked system of 30 European countries, taking into account the capacity investment and operation of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation, transmission, and different storage options. A considerable robustness of total system costs to the input weather data and to moderate changes in the cost assumptions is observed. Flat directions in the optimisation landscape around cost-optimal configurations often allow system planners to choose between different technology options without a significant increase in total costs, for instance by replacing onshore with offshore wind power capacity in case of public acceptance issues. Exploring a range of carbon dioxide emission limits shows that for scenarios with moderate transmission expansion, a reduction of around 57% compared to 1990 levels is already cost optimal. For stricter carbon dioxide limits, power generated from gas turbines is at first replaced by generation from increasing renewable capacities. Non-hydro storage capacities are only built for low-emission scenarios, in order to provide the necessary flexibility to meet peaks in the residual load.},

Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

The results show that the system LCOE for VRE increases linearly with the penetration level range of 20%–80%, above which it increases sharply. Systems that have a high penetration of VRE are characterized by using wind power as the major generating technology and having strong expansion of transmission capacity. A sensitivity analysis for the cost of VRE and variation management capacity (storage and transmission) reveals that the point of increase in marginal LCOE is robust under different future scenarios regarding technology costs. We conclude that VRE could constitute the bulk of electricity generation at a reasonable cost, given that there is availability of variation management, especially with respect to transmission.},

These largely depend on the spatial allocation of the wind turbines. Therefore the question is how to design policies that minimise the social costs of wind power generation which are defined as the sum of production and external costs. An instrument which is used in Germany and elsewhere to control the externalities of wind turbines is the prescription of minimum distances to sensitive landscape features like human settlements and bird nests. The efficient (i.e. minimising social costs) magnitude of such minimum distances, however, depends on uncertain parameters. We apply a robustness analysis to an ecological-economic model for the assessment of the social costs of wind power deployment in order to identify policies, each defined by certain minimum distances, which are favourable within wide ranges of various uncertain parameters. In the examined study region in Germany, rather large minimum distances to nests of the red kite (a raptor bird) and moderate minimum distances to settlements turn out to be most favourable taken the considered uncertainties into account.},

The government aims at adding hydropower capacities in North–Brazil, additional to wind and thermal power generation.

We therefore assess how future greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production in Brazil can be minimized by optimizing the daily dispatch of photovoltaic (PV), wind, thermal, and hydropower plants. Using a simulation model, we additionally assess the risk of loss of load. Results indicate that at doubled demand in comparison to 2013, only 2% of power production has to be provided by thermal power. Existing reservoirs of hydropower are sufficient to balance variations in renewable electricity supply at an optimal mix of around 37% of PV, 9% of wind, and 50% of hydropower generation. In a hydro-thermal only scenario, the risk of deficit increases tenfold, and thermal power production four-fold. A sensitivity analysis shows that the choice of meteorological data sets used for simulating renewable production affects the choice of locations for PV and wind power plants, but does not significantly change the mix of technologies.},

The model is comprised of five scenarios for 100% renewable energy power systems in North-East Asia with different high voltage direct current transmission grid development levels, including industrial gas demand and additional energy security. Renewables can supply enough energy to cover the estimated electricity and gas demands of the area in the year 2030 and deliver more than 2000TWhth of heat on a cost competitive level of 84€/MWhel for electricity. Further, this can be accomplished for a synthetic natural gas price at the 2013 Japanese liquefied natural gas import price level and at no additional generation costs for the available heat. The total area system cost could reach 69.4€/MWhel, if only the electricity sector is taken into account. In this system about 20% of the energy is exchanged between the 13 regions, reflecting a rather decentralized character which is supplied 27% by stored energy. The major storage technologies are batteries for daily storage and power-to-gas for seasonal storage. Prosumers are likely to play a significant role due to favourable economics. A highly resilient energy system with very high energy security standards would increase the electricity cost by 23% to 85.6€/MWhel. The results clearly show that a 100% renewable energy based system is feasible and lower in cost than nuclear energy and fossil carbon capture and storage alternatives.},

The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power (CSP) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering CSP as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60% and 70% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20% of the demand for theoretical VRE shares of up to 100%. Furthermore, we determine that the VRE supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.},

The possibility of achieving 100% RES systems is being debated but concerns about costs, storage and backup capacity still prevail. This paper addresses the topic of renewable energy scenarios for the electricity sector, analyzing different possible future strategies for the Portuguese system. Each one of these strategies is characterized according to the expected electricity consumption and renewable share, with the final aim of analyzing a possible 100% RES scenario. The energy system analysis tool EnergyPLAN was used for simulating each scenario for a one year period. The 100% RES scenario is found to be theoretically possible but a significant increase on the total capacity of the system would be necessary to ensure no shortfall during the summer season. The outcome would be the existence of critical excess electricity production during the winter and also a significant increase of the total cost of the system. The importance of the interconnection as stabilization measure along with the inclusion of storage systems is discussed for a system highly dependent on renewable energy sources.},

To quantify general features of such a weather dependent electricity supply in the contiguous US, wind and solar PV generation data are calculated, based on 32 years of weather data with temporal resolution of 1h and spatial resolution of 40×40km2, assuming site-suitability-based and stochastic wind and solar capacity distributions. The regional wind-and-solar mixes matching load and generation closest on seasonal timescales cluster around 80% solar share, owing to the US summer load peak. This mix more than halves long-term storage requirements, compared to wind only. The mixes matching generation and load best on daily timescales lie at about 80% wind share, due to the nightly gap in solar production. Going from solar only to this mix reduces backup energy needs by about 50%. Furthermore, we calculate shifts in FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)-level LCOE (Levelized Costs Of Electricity) for wind and solar PV due to differing weather conditions. Regional LCOE vary by up to 29%, and LCOE-optimal mixes largely follow resource quality. A transmission network enhancement among FERC regions is constructed to transfer high penetrations of solar and wind across FERC boundaries, employing a novel least-cost optimization.},

This paper defines cost-optimal pathways towards a sustainable power system in the region by employing linear optimization. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes the required capacities and the hourly operation of generation, transmission, and storage. The obtained results show that all different kinds of renewable sources will have to be utilized, while none of them should have a share of more than one third. The findings give reason for setting up an ASEAN power grid, as it enables the transportation of electricity from the best sites to load centers and leads to a balancing of the fluctuations from wind and solar generation. We suggest fostering a diversified extension of renewables and to elaborate on political and technical solutions that enable the build up an transnational supergrid.},

Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system.

Concerning hydropower potential, a considerable share of 68% is already realized. To reach European and national climate and energy policy objectives (e.g. 20-20-20 targets), Austria has to increase its share of renewable energy sources. For hydropower the national energy strategy of 2010 assumes additional 3.5TWh (12.6PJ) until 2015. Thereof, 2.8TWh (10.1PJ) should be realized by new constructions and 0.7TWh (2.5PJ) by improvements in energy efficiency and revitalization of existing facilities. However, hydropower has its limitations. A further development of hydropower can conflict with environmental targets protecting surface water bodies.

Participants were required to register their opinion towards development at a number of on- and off-shore locations in the UK. The results indicated that participants were most favourable to offshore development and least favourable to development at the identified sites. Attitudes to onshore development indicated that so long as a proposed location was anticipated to be ‘out of sight’ it was considered in relatively general terms. The results are discussed with reference to site visibility and landscape concerns and clearly support calls for a shift towards community-focussed development strategies.},

In existing optimization models that minimize the total cost of the energy system, location-specific VRES production profiles are often used to estimate VRES potential, but land-use and land cover aspects have been largely ignored. In this study, we therefore connect the literature in land cover assessment, VRES potential estimation and energy system optimization modelling by proposing a spatially explicit planning approach. This approach was applied to a case of the Netherlands to showcase its applicability and strength and to give results towards various RES targets. A baseline land-use scenario, a scenario with stricter constraints on land-use that reflects social resistance and spatial policy on wind energy and, thirdly, a scenario assuming unlimited land availability were analyzed. The baseline scenario results show the optimal geographical distribution of the generation capacities over the Netherlands. Wind energy dominates the generation mix and storage is only present at the 100% RES target. Under the strict constraints on land-use, 92% of the suitable land in the country will be deployed to place wind turbines in order to reach 100% RES share compared to 37% in the baseline case. However, the cost of electricity only increases by no more than 5 €/MWh. The unlimited land scenario highlights that the regional optimized capacities are infeasible. Apart from the useful results from the case study, the proposed approach is a first-of-a-kind contribution to the literature and provides a data-driven way to operationalize the location-specific land-use of VRES such that the role of the constraints on the land-use of VRES can be revealed and that policy-relevant results can be obtained.},

Based on an Austrian case study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCafé discussions, with stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements. The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of environmental and economic gains and losses.This article is part of a Virtual Special Issue entitled 'The collaborative } # making # { of Energy Landscapes'.},

  abstract = {Electricity market models, implemented as dynamic programming problems, have been applied widely to identify possible pathways towards a cost-optimal and low carbon electricity system. However, the joint optimization of generation and transmission remains challenging, mainly due to the fact that commercial trades do not directly translate into power flows on a specific line in meshed networks. Instead, loop flows occur and potentially impact the entire transmission system. This paper presents a methodology that allows optimizing transmission investments under flow-based market coupling and complements established electricity market models implemented in a linear programming environment that are suitable for solving large-scale problems. The algorithm developed is based on a linear ‘DC’ representation of the physical load flow equations, expressed as power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs). It iteratively updates the PTDFs when grid infrastructures are modified due to cost-optimal extension and thus yields an optimal solution with a consistent representation of physical load flows. The method is first demonstrated on a simplified three-node model where it is found to be robust and convergent. It is then applied to the European power system in order to find its cost-optimal development under the prescription of strongly decreasing CO2 emissions until 2050.},

  abstract = {The broadening of our energy system to include increasing amounts of wind and solar has led to significant debate about the total costs and benefits associated with different types of generators—with potentially far-reaching policy implications. This has included debate about the cost associated with integrating these generators onto the electric grid. For photovoltaics (PV), this encompasses costs incurred on both the bulk power and distribution systems, as well as the value provided to them. These costs and benefits, in particular those associated with integrating PV onto the distribution system, are not well understood. We seek to advance the state of understanding of “grid integration costs” for the distribution system by reviewing prior literature and outlining a transparent, bottom-up approach that can be used to calculate these costs. We provide a clear delineation of costs to integrate PV in to the distribution system within the larger context of total costs and benefits associated with PV generators. We emphasize that these costs are situationally dependent, and that a single “cost of integration” cannot be obtained. We additionally emphasize that benefits must be considered when evaluating the competitiveness of the technology in a given situation.},

  abstract = {The presence of solar energy systems has increased significantly in recent years both in rural areas –in the form of solar farms–, and in urban areas as part of building installations. This transformation of the landscape, in spite of the good social acceptance of solar energy, causes an aesthetic impact whose interest has been growing in literature in recent years. This study aimed to review prior literature in order to establish the objective factors, aesthetic perception and methods that are most relevant when assessing the aesthetic impact. As a result of the lack of consensus, a new qualitative methodological framework is proposed that can serve as a basis for future research in the field of the integration of solar energy and its aesthetic impact. The framework comprises three sub-impacts: land use, solar system energy and glare. The results are discussed for future research and innovation in building photovoltaic integration and for SES site location and its environmental impact assessments.},

    abstract = {Renewable electricity can fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but large land requirements may cause land-use conflicts. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore the relationship between land requirements and total system cost of different supply-side options in the future. Cost-minimal fully renewable electricity requires some 97,000 km2 (2% of total) land for solar and wind power installations, roughly the size of Portugal, and includes large shares of onshore wind. Replacing onshore wind with offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV reduces land requirements drastically with only small cost penalties. Moving wind power offshore is most cost-effective and reduces land requirements by 50% for a cost penalty of only 5%. Wind power can alternatively be replaced by photovoltaics, leading to a cost penalty of 10% for the same effect. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost.},

    year = {2020},
    abstract = {While wind power is a low-carbon renewable energy technology with relatively little land footprint, the necessary infrastructure expansion still has land-related environmental impacts. Brazil has seen more than a ten-fold increase in wind power capacity in the last decade. However, little is known about these impacts of wind power generation in Brazil compared to other world regions, although Brazilian wind power infrastructure is concentrated in the least protected ecosystems that are prone to degradation, desertification and species extinction. This study focuses on land-use impacts of past wind power generation development in four Brazilian federal states, covering 80% of the country’s installed capacity. We assessed their spatial installation patterns, associated land-use and land cover change in the period before installation until 2018, and potential alternative installation locations, using a detailed wind turbine location database in combination with a high-resolution land-use and land cover map. In contrast to wind parks built in Europe, we found that 62% of the studied wind park area was covered by native vegetation and coastal sands. Overall, 3.2% of the total wind cluster area was converted from native vegetation to anthropogenic use. Wind parks installed mainly on native vegetation, on average, underwent higher land-use change compared to other wind parks. As Brazil intends to more than double its current wind power capacities by 2029, we explored possibilities to reduce environmental risks due to wind power expansion. We showed that this is feasible by integrating wind parks into human-altered areas, as sufficient wind resources there are available.},
