# * government programme states that 27 TWh electricity need to be added to reach renewable electricity generation equal
# to "100%" of electricity consumption (excluding industry self consumption and system services).
# In 2016, renewable electricity generation in Austria was 51.1 TWh. Adding to this the 27 TWh of additional renewable
# generation and industry self generation and consumption (4.75 TWh in 2016 *ยง) as well as electricity consumption for
# ancillary services (which we do not model) we arrive at total electricity consumption of
# 51.1 TWh + 27 TWh + 4.75 TWh = 82.85 TWh in 2030
# *ยง Industry own generation and consumption was calculated as total fossil generation from industry-owned units (UEA)
# (excluding energy industry). In 2016 this equates to 4 752 907 MWh, according to extended energy balances of
# Statistics Austria (2020).

"""
- GERMANY:
  - nuclear exit
  - proposal of coal commission is followed, i.e. reduction of 9 GW lignite and 11 GW coal till 2030
  - oil and natural gas-fired capacities remain unchanged
  - biomass additions according to EEG 2017 (+1.05 GW)
- AUSTRIA:
  - follows scenario 2030 DG from ENTSO-E's Ten Year Network Development Plan 2018 (TYNDP 2018) for
    conventional capacities:
             Country    Gas   Hard coal   Oil   Biomass
    2030 DG       AT   3928           0   174       620
